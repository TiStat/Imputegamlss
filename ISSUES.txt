(1) multiple columns to impute (probably via changing the datasplit function W); make an imputation hirarchy

(2) y fit + variability of imputations

(2.1) yfit adjusted gamlss covariate plot with confidence bands

(3) check validity of imputations; their little variability is weird.
    also plot legend.

(4) samplecensored option to evaluate the (censored) conditional quantiles of the distribution from which each x is drawn.
write it such, that at each observation for which it is imputed, the density is evaluated for each entry of the quantiles provided
by a vector. 
this option is called by the to be written function, that visualizes x vs y with imputed data. 
the quantile values that (4) creates shall than be visualized as horizontal |-------| Intervals e.g. 
(0.05, 0.95) as alternative a boxplot with the respective "theoretical quantiles" of the distribution from which the imputation 
are drawn should be plotted horizontally. 
CAREFULL, when implementing censtype = 'interval', quantiles become ambigous!
(4.1) Since y is an explanatory variable for x, why not invert the axis of that plot? such that y is plotted against x 

(4.2)NOTE! ever since the bootmodels are used to draw imputations based on the current parameter set,
The distribution of the later averaged imputation is not as easily computed. the true distribution of the average does contain even more uncertainty!!!!

(5) testthat devtools, unittests.
(5.1) family_fun is func a valid! string?

(6) samplecensored, censtype = 'interval' branch SEE (4)!!! ambiguity with quantiles!

(7) 'censtype' in abuse of notation is also missing
