(1) multiple columns to impute (probably via changing the datasplit function W); make an imputation hirarchy

(2) y fit + variability of imputations; adjusting the uncertainty of y fit, knowing that imputations are loaded with uncertainty.

(2.1) yfit adjusted gamlss covariate plot with confidence bands

(4) NOTE! ever since the bootmodels are used to draw imputations based on the current parameter set,
The distribution of the later averaged imputation is not as easily computed. the true distribution of the average does contain even more uncertainty!!!!

(5) testthat devtools, unittests.

(6) 'censtype' in abuse of notation is also missing
