(1) multiple columns to impute (probably via changing the datasplit function W); make an imputation hirarchy

(2) y fit + variability of imputations

(2.1) yfit adjusted gamlss covariate plot with confidence bands

(3) check validity of imputations; their little variability is weird.
    also plot legend.

(4) samplecensored option to evaluate the (censored) conditional quantiles of the distribution from which each x is drawn.
write it such, that at each observation for which it is imputed, the density is evaluated for each entry of the quantiles provided
by a vector. 
this option is called by the to be written function, that visualizes x vs y with imputed data. 
the quantile values that (4) creates shall than be visualized as horizontal |-------| Intervals e.g. 
(0.05, 0.95) as alternative a boxplot with the respective "theoretical quantiles" of the distribution from which the imputation 
are drawn should be plotted horizontally.
(4.1) Since y is an explanatory variable for x, why not invert the axis of that plot? such that y is plotted against x 

(5) testthat devtools, unittests.
