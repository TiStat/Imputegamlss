\title{Inverse sampling - GAMLSS}
\usage{
samplecensored(object, censtype, predictdata, fitdata, censor,
  quantiles = c(0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.95), intervalstart = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{gamlss. Fitted model whose parameters are predicted for
predictdata.}

\item{censtype}{character. Specifies the type of censoring (right/left/interval/missing).}

\item{predictdata}{dataframe. predict-data of the missing/censored
observations, for which imputations are drawn.}

\item{fitdata}{data.frame. The orignal dataset upon which gamlss was fitted.}

\item{censor}{character. Name of the (damaged) column to be predicted on in
predictdata. This is only required if censtype is NOT "missing".}

\item{quantiles}{vector. Containing the quantiles to be evaluated in the
conditoned distribution, i.e. conditoned on the parameters and the
information contained in the censored value.}

\item{intervalstart}{character. Name of the column of the interval's starting
values. By convention, the starting duration in this column is assumed to
be the time passed without failure, before entering the interval, in which
the exact time of failure is unknown.}
}
\value{
Returns draws and quantiles.
}
\description{
Inverse sampling of censored variables to impute only valid
  observations, conditional on the respective fit.
